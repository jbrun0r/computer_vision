| 11       | Open a colored image with a white background and a centered black square, convert it to grayscale, view the input image. Create a static matrix with the same dimensions as the input image (check the image properties in Windows). Take each of the pixels from the image and place them in the matrix you created. Calculate the coordinates (xc, yc) representing the centroid of this square. Try to paint or mark it on the image for visualization. Xc will be the average of all x coordinates that belong to the square, and yc is the average of y coordinates of the square. The coordinates of the square are identified by the black color (value 0). Create this input image in Paint.     |

Use a point inside the black circle as a seed, which you must determine by analyzing the image beforehand. The rule for region adherence should be: "Whenever a neighbor of the region has a grayscale value less than 127, add this neighbor to the region."

When you finish defining region 2, click on another object, labeling this region as 2 and painting it in blue. Do the same for a third object, painting it green and labeling its region as 3.
